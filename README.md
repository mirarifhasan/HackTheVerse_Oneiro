# HackTheVerse_Oneiro

In COVID-19 pandemic, a **software solution** to get and apply appropriate operations based on the real time patient’s sensed data by the health workers.

This project was built during the [hackathon](https://fb.me/e/1z3PtkzSg). 



# Technologies

*   PHP
*   Bootstrap
*   MySQL



# Features

*   By the patient's cough sound (audio clip/mobile application), an ML model detects COVID-19 without any kit. (Recent MIT research with high accuracy)
*   Patients data will be viewable to the doctor in real-time
*   Doctor’s activity will also be tracked by the software. No doubts should be there on doctor’s duty performance
*   To save doctor’s time, our solution will prioritize patients' lists based on sensed data. So that, serious patients can get treatment quickly
*   The Internet is not an Issue. Sensed data will be received by the server through encoded SMS If the Internet is unavailable in a certain region
*   There is an emergency alert for certain emergency case
*   There will also be a heat map showing the hotspots of the disease detected by our system
